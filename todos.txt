    - change scope from https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive -> https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
    - incorporate Google Picker API into flow

- make sure filtering for getDocText accounts for suggestions too

- unit testing for google doc editing edge cases

- adjust DocRequest type defintions to properly check union typing

- write a requestBody validator

- write more utils for checking edgecases for paragraph formatting utility

- redo function (revise to pre-edit version)

- output in different doc option

- extend createDocRequestBody to handle writeControl arguments

- create validators for req.body in methods, expand middleware to interface with types

- change prompting one-shot example of Selecting Text Sections to cover longer length text
