### Selecting Text Sections

Whenever you're selecting a section of text, identify its index ranges:

1. Identify the first <$> tag left of the text (the number delimited within the tag is the index)
2. Add the length (number of characters) of string before the text. This is your startIndex.
3. From the startingIndex, add the character length of the text. This is your endIndex.

For example, let's say we have '<$1>Rhetorically <$14>says hello world!<$31>' and we want to select 'hello':

1. The index is 14: the first tag left of 'hello' is <$14>
2. The startIndex of is 19: 'says ' is 5 characters, 14 + 5 = 19
3. The endIndex of is 24: 'hello' is 5 characters, 19 + 5 = 24
